# Objective

In this hands-on, you will enrich your initial API with new features. 

---
# Resource

You will add new path to display orders and items in order

```
/orders
/orders/123/items
```

---
# Versioning

We will add a breaking change and create a new version of our API.
If it's not done, you can rename your initial endpoint in v1/orders.
Other endpoints stay in v1.
```
v2/orders
```
> Don't forget to document this evolution in your API documentation (and deprecate old endpoints). 

---
# Filtering, sorting & pagination

We will add a new path and new features to our API on the merchants endpoint.
We want to allow our customer to filter, to sort and to paginate.

```
/merchants?page=1&limit=20&category=fastfood&sort=price&order=asc
```
