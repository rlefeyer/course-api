# Objective

In this tutorial, you will be guided step by step to build a food delivery system. First, we will start creating this project by creating a NestJS project. 

---
# Stacks

You will be guided to be able to use some of the tools below:
- NestJS as backend framework
- Swagger as API documentation
- and sure, Typescript as programming language
  
---
# Development Environment

Make sure that on your local laptop you have the tools installed as below:
- NodeJS + NPM
- IDE like VSCode or Intellij

---
# Create a NestJs project

Create a new NestJS application
We can begin by using this simple command :

```sh
$ npm i -g @nestjs/cli
$ nest new deliveroo
$ cd deliveroo
```

---
# Generate REST Resource
<!-- What are the ressources ? Make student choose the ressources and the attibutes-->
NestJS makes it very easy for developers to create resources using REST. You will be asked to fill in some data using the Nest CLI below.
```sh
npx nest generate resource
```
A CLI prompt will appear, and you will be asked to select it.
1. What name would you like to use for this resource (plural, e.g., “users”)? **orders**
2. What transport layer do you use? **REST API**
3. Would you like to generate CRUD entry points? **Yes**

---
# Generate REST Resource

You’ll also find a new src/orders directory with all the files you need to build a REST endpoint. 
The src/orders/orders.controller.ts file contains a route handler that holds requests and passes responses from different endpoints. While the file src/orders/orders.service.ts, which we will fill later with the logic of this order's endpoint.

# Documentation
## Setup Swagger API Doc
Swagger is an API Documentation tool that uses the [OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification). Luckily, NestJS has wrapped it in its own package. To be able to install it use this command
```
npm install --save @nestjs/swagger
```

---
# Setup Swagger API Doc
<!-- Now open main.ts file and initiate Swagger using SwaggerModule -->
```
// src/main.ts
import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';
import { SwaggerModule, DocumentBuilder } from '@nestjs/swagger';

async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  const config = new DocumentBuilder()
    .setTitle('Deliveroo')
    .setDescription('The Deliveroo API description')
    .setVersion('0.1')
    .build();
  const document = SwaggerModule.createDocument(app, config);
  SwaggerModule.setup('api', app, document);
  await app.listen(3000);
}
bootstrap();
```
---
# Setup Swagger API Doc

As long as the application is running, then open this address **localhost:3000/api**. You will see that the swagger display can be used.

The **[@ApiProperty](https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/types-and-parameters)** decorator makes the variables in a class visible and readable by the SwaggerModule. 
The **[@ApiResponse](https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/operations)** allows you to define a custom HTTP response
> For more details, you can read the documentation directly.

# Update the documentation

Provide documentation for all endpoints :
- Keep only useful endpoints
- Description for each endopoint
- Add attributes in the model and specify the mandatory attributes
- Specify error codes
